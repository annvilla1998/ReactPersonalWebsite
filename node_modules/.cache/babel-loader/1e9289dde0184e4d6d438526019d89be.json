Here, I coded for around 60 hours a week studying various languages while collaborating with diverse developers daily. I was able to apply my skills at an unbelievable rate and my curiosity to learn more increased. At AppAcademy, I learned an extensive range of technical skills. Not only that but I also learned how to master and quickly apply skills. I am super eager to prove my value and talent at a company that has the same energy.
