                My name is Anabel Villalobos and welcome to my personal website. The day I stumbled across CodeAcademy is when I decided I found everythin I was looking for in a career. 
                I loved the rush of executing coding challenges and lessons. Coding reminded me of video games. Trying to solve a bug is like trying to beat a game. I instantly fell in love. 
                Shortly after realizing this is what I want to do for the rest of my life, I enrolled in AppAcademy. Here, I coded 
                for around 60 hours a week studying various languages while collaborating with diverse developers daily. I was able to apply my skills at an unbelievable rate 
                and my curiosity to learn more increased. At AppAcademy, I learned an extensive range of technical skills. Not only that but I also learned how to master and quickly 
                apply skills. I am super eager to prove my value and talent at a company that has the same energy. I love working on teams who love to create and keep each other motivated. 
                I hope to rise in this sort of environment, bringing the engineering skills I continue to develop everyday along with me.
